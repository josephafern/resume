				<h2>Relevant Course Experience:</h2>
				<h3>Computer Science Background - </h3>
				<p>Core CS curriculum at Stanford. These courses 
				provided an extensive experience in systems architecture,
				memory management and performance optimization. I am 
				proficient in HTML, CSS and (soon to be) Javascript.</p>
				<h3>Pre-Colonial & Contemporary Philosophy - </h3>
				<p>- Series of courses focused on philosophical ideologies
				and the sociological implications of their effects on human 
				history and behavior. Maintaining a concentration in pre-modern 
				Taoist, Existential and Romantic philosophies, I've gained a 
				unique perspective on different theories of ontology and 
				sociology, acquiring insight into historical movements and their 
				relation to both ancient and contemporary modes of thought. 
				Through this program, Iâ€™ve been given thorough experience in 
				critical analysis, writing and editing.</p>
