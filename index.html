				<h2>Relevant Course Experience:</h2>
				<h3>Computer Science Background - </h3>
				<p>Core CS curriculum at Stanford. These courses 
				provided an extensive experience in systems architecture,
				memory management and performance optimization. I am 
				proficient in HTML, CSS and (soon to be) Javascript.</p>
				<h3>Pre-Colonial & Contemporary Philosophy - </h3>
				<p>- Series of courses focused on philosophical ideologies
				and the sociological implications of their effects on human 
				history and behavior. Maintaining a concentration in pre-modern 
				Taoist, Existential and Romantic philosophies, I’ve gained a 
				unique perspective on different theories of ontology and 
				sociology, acquiring insight into historical movements and their 
				relation to both ancient and contemporary modes of thought. 
				Through this program, I’ve been given thorough experience in 
				critical analysis, writing and editing.</p>
